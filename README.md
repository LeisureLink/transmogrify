# Transmogrify

Transforms json objects from one to another in a surprising or magical manner.  Transmogrify has 3 main objectives.

1. Conversion between XML <-> JSON
2. Transforming JSON <-> JSON
3. Map reducing JSON Sources -> JSON

## XML Conversion

To convert the XML <-> JSON we use the [JXON](https://github.com/tyrasd/jxon) library.




### Roadmap

* Source JSON documents from remote sources
* Cache the orginal and result for a period of time
